# Iris Classification App Using Streamlit
This is a web application that classifies iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The app is built using Streamlit and the classification model is trained using Jupyter notebook.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+<br>
Streamlit<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
Pandas<br>
Numpy<br>
## Installation
* Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
* Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.<br>
* Run the app using `streamlit run app.py`.<br>
## Usage
Once you run the app using streamlit run app.py, a browser window will open up with the app.<br>
Enter the values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width in the provided input fields.<br>
Click on the 'Classify' button to get the predicted class for the input values.<br>
## Dataset
The classification model is trained on the Iris dataset, which is a popular dataset for classification tasks. The dataset contains 150 samples with 3 classes of iris flowers (50 samples for each class).

## Model
The classification model is a simple logistic regression model, trained on the Iris dataset. The model achieves an accuracy of 97.8% on the test set.

## Acknowledgements
The Iris dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
